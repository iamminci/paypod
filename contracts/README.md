One of the main bottlenecks to the adoption of web3 gaming is the user experience. Namely, in web3 games when a player has to make a simple token transfer or an update to an on-chain state, the current experience requires players to use their wallet to confirm a transaction in the middle of gameplay which is disruptive to the player experience - as it completely takes them out of the moment. But what if there was a way that in-game payments are as seamless as they are in traditional web2 games?

That’s why I’ve built PayPod. On the PayPod platform, a pod is a smart contract that acts as an account abstraction for players in web3 games. Like a prepaid card, a user can deposit funds into a pod they’ve created for a specific game, then allow the game’s contracts to control the funds in the pod such that the in-game payment experience becomes truly seamless.

PayPod is a platform that allows users to easily deploy and manage their pods that allows web3 games to handle in-game payments on behalf of the users.

Features

1. Create a pod for a web3 game of your choice
2. Assign games as controllers to the pod for account management
3. Manage pod balance, ownership, and transaction history
4. Onboarding documents for web3 games to integrate into existing projects
